2005-05-21 Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	When loading EcmaUncompiledHelpSources, don't
	created the help source in browser.cs because it
	needs to be created and added to help_sources at the
	same time, because of the static id variable being
	incremented in the HelpSource constructor. The
	DLL is affected too.
	  
	* browser.cs: Send the paths to uncompiled
	  help, rather than the help sources.

2005-05-08  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: use $(RUNTIME) rather than `mono'

2005-04-27 Mike Kestner <mkestner@novell.com>

	* admin.* : moved here from monodoc/browser.

2005-04-23 Mike Kestner <mkestner@novell.com>

2005-02-03  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* xhtml-provider.cs : added more URI scheme. Without them monkeyguide

	* ecma-provider.cs : MS.NET will complain about access to nonpublic 
	  class on XSL extension object (which mono currently does
	  not check. see bug #70841). So make the class public for now.

	it to hang debugger info.

2005-01-24  Joshua Tauberer  <tauberer@for.net>
	
	* mono-ecma.xsl: Indent the namespace summaries with blockquote.
	  Show namespace-relative type names in the namespace remarks
	  sections.
	* ecma-provider.cs: Since there are namespace Xml files repeated
	  in the different assembly directories, Monodoc would use the
	  last one, whereas only one would have the real namespace
	  summary/remarks.  Now it ignores an Xml file if it contains
	  an empty or "To be added." namespace summary.

2005-01-22  Joshua Tauberer  <tauberer@for.net>

	* ecma-provider.cs: For editing, generating XPath locations
	of the edited node was different for properties than methods/
	constructors, but it should have been the same since properties
	can have parameters too.  It made some indexers uneditable.
	(I meant to commit this at least a month ago.)
	* browser.cs: Renamed the local XML docs editing feature to
	  simply '--edit'
	* mono-ecma.xsl: Cosmetic change to [Edit] links.

2004-12-04  Joshua Tauberer <tauberer@for.net>

	display links to the subsections in the HTML.  This also
	makes a simple table of contents for the root page.

2004-12-01  Raja R Harinath  <rharinath@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am (monodoc_gtk_data): Rename from monodoc_gtk_DATA to
	prevent an automake error.

2004-11-30  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* xhtml-provider.cs (GetAbsoluteLink): Avoid munging urls that
	start with our "magic" prefixes, keep them as they are.

2004-11-30  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* configure.in,
	  browser/monodoc.dll.config.in,
	  browser/Makefile.am : Windows build is now available.
	  - Skip browser.exe and dependency check on Windows.
	  - Fixed gacutil installation location.
	  - Rewrite document location in config (it just contains '.')

2004-11-04  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* colorizer.cs: If a language is unrecognized, escape the XML so that it
	  will be properly rendered within monodoc; 
		- Fix ColorizeXml.  Due to an ordering dependency, the regex to colorize
		  double-quoted strings was also replacing the attributes used in a prior
		  substitution (to colorize XML tags).  This garbled the XML, making it
		  unreadable.  Handling double-quoted strings earlier fixes this.
		- Cleanup braces to follow code conventions.

2004-11-01  Richard Torkar <richard.torkar@htu.se>

	* index.cs: Make sure we catch the System.UnauthorizedAccessException 
	that is thrown when the user has no write permissions to store the 
	index file when using "monodoc --make-index".

2004-09-06  Joshua Tauberer  <tauberer@for.net>

	Editing of ECMA-style documentation directly off of the
	"uncompiled" source XML documents.  Invoked with the
	"--local-edit path-to-doc-sources" command line argument, e.g.:
	--local-edit ../class/corlib/en
	
	Some improvements to the way type names and member signatures
	are displayed in links in the ECMA pages.
	
	Some fixes to the way URLs are parsed by the ECMA provider.

2004-08-25  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* provider.cs: Allow a .source file to add nodes to the tree
	with <node> elements. They will automatically be placed below
	the "Various" node. Something of a hack, but needed for more
	complicated third-party docs.

2004-07-31  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* xhtml-provider.cs: Keep a list of the temporary files we

	* browser.glade: Add a Paste menu item.

2004-07-26  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

2004-07-16  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* xhtml-provider.cs: Take a tocFile parameter telling us which file to load.
	(XhtmlProvider): Pass the tocFile parameter.
	
2004-07-19  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	* ecma-provider.cs: Index enumeration values and delegates as
	well.  The table of context index on my system is now half the
	size of the actual data.  We need a mechanism to compress data. 

2004-07-15  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* ecmaspec-html.xsl: There are nested lists in the ECMA spec: see ecma334/10.8.xml.
	Support them by iterating on <list>s as well as <list_item>s.

2004-06-30  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* mono-ecma.xsl: you can put an element <since version="blah" />
	below the Docs element of a type or member and it will give
	a notice for what versions it is available in.

2004-06-25  Mike Kestner  <mkestner@ximian.com>

2004-06-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@ximian.com>

	upgraded monodoc. LastSeenVersion is a new settign for the last
	version of monodoc to launch (so we can check for fist launch
	of a new version). Close files.

2004-06-19  John Luke  <jluke@cfl.rr.com>

	* browser.glade: stockify the Close and Save buttons while editing

	* browser.cs/glade: New browser menu item View-->Show Inherited Members for the member listing page.
	* ecma-provider.cs:
		Nested types are shown in the type tree as OuterType+InnerType, and lookups were fixed to handle that.
		Namespace nodes now have all of the types within them sorted.
		At run time, the type hierarchy information is inserted into the type XML data based on
		the XML content, so the type hierarchy can be shown without using reflection.
		At the same time, inherited members are dynamically copied into the XML data, if the setting is on.
	* mono-ecma.xsl: The type hierarchy, inherited members support,
	* settings.cs: A setting for showing inherited members in the member listing.
