IMPORTANT NOTES

* Gendarme "official" build system is based on the auto*/Makefile files
and tested on MonkeyWrench. See mono-tools-trunk on 
http://build.mono-project.com/index.aspx?lane=mono-trunk
(checking out gendarme without its parent dir 'mono-tools' is not supported)

* Visual Studio solutions and projects files (usable by both MonoDevelop
and Visual Studio .NET 2008) are NOT always up to date with Makefiles. 
This depends on the developer making changes and his personal access to 
the developing environments. (Please see the README.vsnet file.)
