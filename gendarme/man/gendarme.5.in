.SH NAME
Gendarme \- Rule-based code analysis for Mono.

.SH FILE FORMATS
.TP
.I ignore-file
This file is used to filter out defects from gendarme reports. It uses a line oriented
file format where the first characters of the line control the interpretation of the line:
.RS
# - means that the line is a comment.
.RE
.RS
R: - if the full name of a rule to be filtered.
.RE
.RS
A: - is used to filter out an assembly (the extension can be omitted).
.RE
.RS
T: - is used to filter out a namespace qualified type name.
.RE
.RS
M: - is used to filter out a method. It must contain the full method name as it appears in the report.
.RE

An ignore-file can be generated automatically (using gd2i) from a XML 
defect list produced by \fIGendarme\fP.

.TP
.I rules.xml
This file is used in conjunction with the --set option to control and configure the rules
used by Gendarme. It contains a set of named rules (rule sets) and each rule set contains 
a list of rules. Rules have required from and include attributes, optional exclude and
applyTo attributes, and optional parameter child elements.

The from attribute is the path of a dll to load ("Gendarme.Rules.BadPractice.dll").
Relative paths are relative to the gendarme executable.

The include attribute may be "*" to match every rule in the dll or a list of rule names
separated by '|' ("WhizBangRule | MyRule").

The exclude attribute is a list of rule names separated by '|' ("IckyRule").
These will override any rules matched by the include attribute.

The applyTo attribute may be "all", "visible", or "nonvisible". If it is all (the default) then
all types in the assemblies are checked, if it is visible then only the externally visible
types are checked, if it is nonvisible then only the internally visible types are checked.

The parameter child element is used to customize the behavior of a rule within a dll.
It has three required attributes: rule, property, and value. rule is the name of the
applicable rule ("AvoidSmallNamespaceRule"), property is the name of a public
property in the rule ("Minimum"), value is the value to assign to the property ("10").
.TP
.I gendarme.exe.config
Used by debug versions of Gendarme to enable logging for rules. A config
file will be generated automatically by the make file. To enable logging
for a rule edit the config file, add a switch using the rule's name, and set the 
value to 1.
