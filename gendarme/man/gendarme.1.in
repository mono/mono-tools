.TH Gendarme "Gendarme @GENDARME_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
Gendarme \- Rule-based code analysis for Mono.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B gendarme [--config configfile] [--set ruleset] [--log file | --xml file | --html file] [options] assemblies ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIGendarme\fP is a extensible rule-based tool used to find problems in .NET 
applications and libraries. Gendarme inspects programs and libraries that
contain code in ECMA CIL format (Mono and .NET) and looks for common 
problems with the code, problems that compilers do not typically check or
have historically not checked.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I "--config configfile"
Specify the rule sets and rule settings. Default is 'rules.xml'.
.TP
.I "--set ruleset"
Specify a rule set from configfile. Defaults to 'default'.
.TP
.I "--log file"
Save the report to the specified file. If none of --log, --xml, or --html are used
then the report is written to stdout.
.TP
.I "--xml file"
Save the report, formatted as XML, to the specified file.
.TP
.I "--html file"
Save the report, formatted as HTML, to the specified file.
.TP
.I "--ignore ignore-file"
Do not report defects listed in the specified file.
.TP
.I "--limit N"
Stop reporting after N defects are found.
.TP
.I "--severity [all | audit[+] | low[+|-] | medium[+|-] | high[+|-] | critical[-]],...
Filter the reported defects to include the specified severity levels.
Default is 'medium+' (i.e. low and audit levels are ignored).
.TP
.I "--confidence [all | low[+] | normal[+|-] | high[+|-] | total[-]],...
Filter the reported defects to include the specified confidence levels.
Default is 'normal+' (i.e. low level is ignored).
.TP
.I "--quiet"
Used to disable progress and other information which is normally written to stdout.
.TP
.I "--v|verbose"
When present additional progress information is written to stdout. May be used
more than once to write even more info. 
.TP
.I "--version"
Display Gendarme's version number. This will match the Mono version number
that this copy of Gendarme was released with.
.TP
.I "assemblies ..."
Specify the assemblies to verify. You can specify multiple filenames, 
including masks (? and *). You can also provide a file that lists several
assemblies (one per line) by prefixing the filename with @ on the command 
line.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ignore-file
This file is used to filter out defects from gendarme reports. 
.TP
.I rules.xml
This file is used in conjunction with the --set option to control and configure the rules
used by Gendarme. It contains a set of named rules (rule sets) and each rule set contains 
a list of rules.
.TP
.I gendarme.exe.config
Used by debug versions of Gendarme to enable logging for rules. It is useful
for Gendarme's developers (i.e. not meant for end-users).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.I GENDARME_COLOR
The runner will use colors when displaying defects on the console. 
By default colors are dark in order to display correctly on any 
background. You can change this default to "light" (lighter colors 
looks nice on a dark background, or "none" so no colors will be used.
E.g.
.nf
    GENDARME_COLOR=none gendarme ...
.fi
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.I 0
The runner returns 0 when no error has occurred. If some code was 
analyzed then this also means that no defects were found and reported.
.TP
.I 1
The runner execution was successful but either some defects where found
or no assembly was specified.
.TP
.I 2
The runner execution was interrupted by I/O errors (e.g. missing files).
.TP
.I 3
The runner founds errors in the (default or user supplied) configuration
files. Specific error messages should be printed on the console.
.TP
.I 4
The runner execution was interrupted by a non-handled exception. This
is likely a bug inside Gendarme and should be reported on Novell's
bugzilla (http://bugzilla.novell.com) or on the mailing-list.
